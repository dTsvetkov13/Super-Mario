# Super-Mario
This is my version of Super Mario. This is my first try of SDL2 library and the game is so simple as it covers only the basics of SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_ttf. There are 2 enemies - BadTurtle and SeverusSnape(Harry Potter character). You have to answer the Snape's question.

The answer for the Snapes's question is "Always".
